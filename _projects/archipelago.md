(proposal for noguchi museum open call for artist banners 2024)

the archipelago: a testament of unity across different peoples, cultures, and languages. here, the rectangular frame is a motif dually representing the digital interfaces we encounter in contemporary life and the psychological framework through which we perceive others. while the frame cannot possibly contain the infinite complexities of reality, the abstract fauna and flora, mirror each other in cooperation with the frame, reflecting the emotional effort required to care for others in spite of perceived faults or misunderstandings. the result is a psycho-topography of ai-generated jungle landscapes, pixelated image scrap, and indeterminate symbols.
