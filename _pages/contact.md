<p>my name is kevin cunanan chappelle and i am a lover of images. and experiences. and plants.</p>

<p>my interest in images extends even and especially beyond what is legible. particularly in digital images, understanding pixels as materialâ€”as light, there is something elemental, even transcendental, in our experience of what we see and take for granted as ordinary. working across different media, from large-scale installations to graphic design, i invite you to challenge your personal assumptions through revelatory encounters with digital space. my work employs a variety of techniques and elements such as live cctv streams, ai-generated imagery, and analog electronics.</p>

<p>i grew up near sacramento, california and am currently based in brooklyn, new york.</p>
