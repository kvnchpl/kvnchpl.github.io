<p>My name is Kevin Cunanan Chappelle and I am a lover of images. And experiences. And plants.</p>

<p>My interest in images extends even and especially beyond what is legible. Particularly in digital images, understanding pixels as materialâ€”as light, there is something elemental, even transcendental, in our experience of what we see and take for granted as ordinary. Working across different media, from large-scale installations to graphic design, I invite you to challenge your personal assumptions through revelatory encounters with digital space. My work employs a variety of techniques and elements such as live CCTV streams, AI-generated imagery, and analog electronics.</p>

<p>I grew up near Sacramento, California and am currently based in Brooklyn, New York.</p>
