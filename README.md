## âœ¨ Site Philosophy

- **No frameworks.** Just HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript.
- **No build system.** Everything is static and transparent.
- **Lightweight and fast.** Images are pre-optimized as `.webp` in multiple sizes.
- **Structured but human.** Content is driven by simple JSON files (`nav.json`, `pages.json`) rather than hardcoded JS.
- **Web 1.0 nostalgia.** Fonts, layout, and flow are designed to feel personal, like a lovingly curated corner of the
early internet.
