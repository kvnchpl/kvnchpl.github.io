maybe i'm not	inspired by my 	grandma | nana
or the years of	(VINEGARY) 	preservation | perseverance
passed down as 			context | stories
tied up
in neat 	bows as a
		(HERE YOU GO!) 	gift | lie
if i forget 	what to say in return
the script is underneath the box
i just have to lift it to see
what they wrote			for me | without me



i can't see the flickering lights
in my apartment because un-patterns
are patterns and un-persons
are the only ones who could know		
maybe i'm wasted
thinking about how to re-person
by hearing my body hum
even if humming isn't explanation
a hum is not a hug
that will remind me of something i've never seen
