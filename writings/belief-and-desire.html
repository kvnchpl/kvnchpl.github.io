belief & desire are,
as i've learned
and learned and learned,
where i begin and where i end.
maybe they're all i've got
and maybe when i'm dead i'll reincarnate into
a spinning wheel, or more precisely, the idea
of a spinning wheelâ€”turning and wanting
and ultimately lacking.

[horrific thoughts begging for release.]
[hell in rotation, one that never loses its train of thought.]
[the privilege of a perfect metaphor in defense of nothing.]
