[intro - dueling horns from spoiled regions]
nervously fidget with the knob to get the volume just right
ah, here comes the percussion ­– imperceptible at first
but begins to skitter across your mind, you find
your dreams here
try to tap along using only your pinky and ring finger for me
cramps are a loving gesture after all
 
[verse - only hi-hats remain alongside a chorus of voices whispering
their names and addresses to each other]
try to eavesdrop but you will only hear the
sound of crinkling aluminum foil, the
quest of rust and of saliva
smile at the person nearest to you and 
hope to catch them fast asleep
 
[chorus - the horns have slaughtered each other, the bass your heartbeat]
tell me when it gets to your favorite part
the sizzling cast iron, the smell of—
ah, I guess I never needed it all along
<span class="strikethrough">the chorus should be played as loud as possible</span>
and every terrible story ends like this
the story i’ve always wanted
 
[outro - bated breath, sometimes accompanied by other indicators of life]
scrunch your toes, smile again
at your nearest neighbor
and let them tell you about the nightmare they had
wipe their tears right as the song ends
