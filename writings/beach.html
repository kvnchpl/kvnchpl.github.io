        <pre id="content">
in which my world was a twisted beach â€”
your chest hairs against my ear,
each a blessed secret coiled onto itself

in which i was an auditorium of one and wondered:
how does it feel to really believe something? 
i believe in your gentle pulse

in which the rushes of air and half sentences
never do me justice,
will my un-secret be you?
