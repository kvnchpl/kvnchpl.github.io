What happened to
the exposed ceramic
chipped bowl
selfish plate
decorated with kitschy blue dots

We both stare at the upturned dish
and I wonder
How do you cope
knowing that you have nowhere to eat
I had hoped that I was more than
delivery
a wish granted
another wish granted

Is your blank stare a request
Is this the moment that you turn
to me and whisper softly
unending moments of silence
in a moving mouth

Grab the chipped bowl
selfish plate
and consume
and I will be happy

Only then will I know
your bitter tears pooling when I'm gone
dripping through microscopic cracks

If you will not eat, I will understand
food for thought in a dish too heavy
If you will not see, I will be patient
a world meant for one and not the other
If you will not love me
love the broken bowl
Keep eating
