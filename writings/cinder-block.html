        <p id="content" style="text-align:justify">lets take a look at this cinder block and measure all of its right
            angles then i want you to look at all of its wrong angles (in the face) and yell at each one YOU WERE WRONG
            AND THAT ONE MISTAKE COST ME MY LIFE just as your fingers are about to reach the sledgehammer to regain not
            only your time but also all the time anyone has ever spent measuring you realize you missed one of those
            right angles (FUCK!) so you recalibrate your compass its metallic arms look a lot like mine actually where
            did you get that i want one of those its not fair because i showed you this cinder block in the first place
            who cares if you were the one to teach me how to swing a sledgehammer why cant you just focus on those right
            angles and stop stealing my shit i know you stole it DO NOT STEAL MY SHIT i know you stole that compass
            because its arms look like mine plus you dont even know how to use it i would have taught you how if you
            asked but you didnt so now neither of us has a compass we can use [every angle of the cinder block leans
            forward] lets try this say we were able to attach three tiny hooks to the cinder block and then hung a tiny
            towel from each of them would you be able to lift it high enough so that by the time the towels slide off
            their hooks i would have enough time before they hit the ground to make the ground lower and lower [allow me
            to pause here] i think the towels would disintegrate as they fell i think the towels would relax themselves
            into glitter that would probably get in your eyes i hope you brought some goggles and (while youre at it) a
            face mask because of all this fucking dust no one (and definitely not me) has swept in here since before i
            even met you and i met you before i knew you and never could i have imagined all the places i got to visit
            since then it actually makes me tear up a bit because they literally dont make cinder blocks anymore so if
            im getting overly upset about these damn angles just know that its because its the last thing ill ever have
            of you just keep the compass ill miss you more than youll miss you ill miss you so much</p>
